# 30DayChallenge-Weather

I started by opening up VSCode, where I have the latest python script as well as AWS access.

After changing the directory and getting into the folder that has access to the 'requirements.txt' file, I was able to complete the install.

I made sure to create the environment, to which I learned that if there is not a specific way to create the environment... the echo command will automatically create the environment.

Next was the process to create the file for the installed requirements.

Finally I entered my AWS credentials to connect to the IAM console as well as access to the S3 buckets.

I was confused by running into this problem.

Was having a bit of trouble until I realized my execution policies were preventing me from being able to execute certain commands.

Here's the view from the AWS console showing the presence of each state that we pulled weather updates from.
